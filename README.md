# Cebong except it's been slightly modified

An ever so slightly modified version of the [Cebong Pelican Theme.](https://github.com/getpelican-themes/cebong) Created primarily for use on my [personal website.](https://airikWarren.github.io)

The WTFPL license is maintained from the original, which as far as I can tell is functionally identical to the MIT license; so feel free to use this theme for any purpose (whether it be educational, commercial, or personal) with or without attribution.
