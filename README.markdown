pelican-cebong-theme
===============

This is a theme for pelican, its structure was derived from the pelican's *notmyidea* theme, and I altered some stuff to look more like [my old tumblr blog](http://kecebongsoft.tumblr.com), which is pretty much solarized-like.

This theme is used for [my pelican blog](http://kecebongsoft.com). Few things to note:

* I'm not a css/html ninja, if you're using this, expect things to break on some untested browsers / resolutions / devices.
* Some layout changes might happened in the future when I want my revamp my blog, but the main idea (simplicity + solarized) will remain.

If you want to fix some css/html stuff, I'll really appreciate it, please do make a pull-request.
